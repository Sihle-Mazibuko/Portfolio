                      Coming into this course I expected to in a way learn more
                      code that was more website based, although it is a
                      combination of theory and practical work, it seems like
                      the ideal place to learn and actively use coding
                      techniques, especially in an art space where you have the
                      freedom to create and display things in a manner that you
                      see fit. So, it allows me to dive into a new space of
                      learning code whilst providing the opportunity to learn
                      how I can best use that code in ways that will help in my
                      artistic endeavours.

                      Being introduced to a new course can always be a new and
                      interesting challenge given that the majority of the time
                      you are being presented with new ideas you may or may not
                      be familiar with and Interactive Media is no exception to
                      this thought. Although there was no intense information
                      being presented to us as it was only the first week and we
                      were only being introduced to topics and setting things
                      up, there was one thing that already seemed like a
                      challenge: navigating GitHub. Understanding how to
                      manipulate projects in the main repository and creating
                      new repositories that can, in turn, affect projects in
                      other repositories whilst also not affecting them was a
                      lot in my opinion. Of course, this will become something
                      easier to do once I regularly use GitHub but when it was
                      presented it seemed complex to use.

                      Vannevar Bush’s “As we may think” was an interesting read
                      as it is fascinating to see someone’s ideal situation for
                      how far technology will advance from a time when there was
                      barely advanced technology (of course at the time radio
                      was a huge advancement however this is comparison is to
                      modern technology). Bush was a brilliant mind for being
                      able to essentially predict what we now know as the
                      internet before it was even a thought during his time.

                      When I first got into coding HTML was one of the easiest
                      languages I could learn, and this is very true. From what
                      we have learned, to the exercises we had to complete,
                      engaging with HTML has been one of the easiest things I
                      have to do, throughout this whole degree. The concepts,
                      formatting and syntax are very easy to understand if you
                      have some form of coding background and even if you have
                      no coding experience HTML is a very easy language to
                      grasp. Having made a website, despite lacking any
                      information, was also very exciting.

                    <p>
                      Internet Histories unfortunately was a horrible experience
                      for me. The reasoning behind this is simply I do not like
                      learning about anything related to history. I am not fond
                      of anything that has to do with history and the fact that
                      all that information about how the internet has progressed
                      over time will not do anything for me besides be
                      interesting facts adds to my disfavour of the topic. The
                      content itself is interesting as it is interesting knowing
                      where this started however to that extent of information
                      whereby it resembles a history.

                      Lawson Bronson’s article was a good read given it gives
                      pointers on some good practices in HTML (such as not
                      overloading on h1’s) and the uses of various semantics
                      used in HTML coding (such as why using nav’s, articles and
                      sections is important). It is a helpful tool book of good
                      practices that can help you code better in HTML.

                      CSS styling so far seems to not have much difficulty to it
                      however with making things look good, being accurate and
                      perfect with your output becomes a factor and that in the
                      long run could be a decisive factor to how hard things are
                      in terms of website styling techniques I will be using. I
                      feel something that CSS takes into consideration (with
                      help from HTML) is how it is important to make your
                      websites easily accessible, in terms of how you use your
                      website and find your website. This draws on last week’s
                      point on semiotics and it seems semiotics is a general
                      practice that can you design well-functional and engaging
                      websites. In terms of my website, there are ideas slowly
                      creeping up as I learn more about how to make efficient
                      websites I am also looking to draw inspiration from
                      websites from companies like Nike, Off-White and Dior.
                      These companies particularly intrigue me because firstly I
                      like fashion but also how easy it is to navigate the
                      website, especially Dior’s website which provides
                      information in text and graphics (in a manner whereby one
                      does not overpower the other) format which I believe is
                      something that is often overlooked especially in websites
                      whereby you are trying to be sold something. Always having
                      to read is not ideal as people have varied attention spans
                      and some people would rather see a video showing
                      information than that same video explained in text format.

                  <h3>Context and Convention</h3>

                    <p>
                      And this brings me to the UI/UX text where the main
                      message was users should be able to fully enjoy your
                      website. It is not only about having a page that shows
                      something, that page should make people want to visit it
                      again if not stay longer than they currently have. This
                      can be achieved by paying attention to important UI/UX
                      elements such as responsiveness, the sizes of different
                      types of information, and particular events that can be
                      performed by the user (through mouse and keyboard inputs)
                      that may affect their experience with the website. The
                      final thought to draw upon is why conventions are
                      important. Steven Mailloux mentioned how
                      <q>
                        traditional conventions capture an essential aspect of
                        our everyday notion of social convention</q
                      >
                      so it is important to never disregard something simple
                      websites practises (such as the back to top button
                      traditionally at the bottom right of every screen). As
                      much as it is your website and you always want to add your
                      touch to things it is important to not stray too far away
                      from the norm because some things are the way they are due
                      to them being a socially acceptable functionality.

                      Working with JavaScript has been fun and this is mainly
                      due to how it reminds me somewhat of C#. From the tasks we
                      were prescribed to the content we learned, JavaScript has
                      a lot of similarities to C# and thus understanding
                      JavaScript’s syntax and practices so far has been easier
                      than expected. This can change however as we dive deeper
                      into JavaScript’s actual use (website functionality)
                      however I foresee this not to be as daunting as it may
                      seem at face value.

                  <div class="content">
                    <p>
                      The reading on The Basic Principles of design was very
                      helpful in giving me a new perspective when trying to
                      design my website and also make me look at most websites
                      in a different light. As mentioned in a previous week most
                      of my styling and design inspirations will come from
                      fashion websites such as dior.com, nike.com and
                      off---white.com these websites don’t take into account
                      basic design principles such as placing users at the
                      centre as information will take up the entire screen at
                      once, reducing cognitive load is also not followed due to
                      the vast majority of information a user has to take in
                      when browsing the website and also aiming for simplicity.
                      This could be due to the fact these are fashion websites
                      and fashion is considered loud and in your face, so they
                      could be an exception to some rules but for a beginner
                      they shouldn’t be a full guide.

                      This led to my researching more websites and finding some
                      interesting designs such as seed.com which try and draw
                      the user’s attention to a central focal point or even
                      eumray.com which is essentially a portfolio sight. What I
                      like most about emuray.com is how it’s as if the creator
                      was trying to flex their UI/UX design capabilities to show
                      that this is who they are and this is what they are
                      capable of. This website makes for a good starting point
                      for a creative person as you are trying to make yourself
                      look good and going towards the simplistic and
                      conventional way of designing a website may not make you
                      stand out but rather hold you back. With this considered
                      it may be time for me to rethink my current wireframes and
                      be more experimental with the design of my website.

                      For these two weeks, there was a lot of time spent
                      reevaluating my designs. A large part of this was through
                      redesigning the wireframes for certain sections of my
                      website and experimenting with UI elements that would make
                      my elements more enjoyable when scrolling through it
                      (without leaving the viewer lost)

                      As of the end of week 6, the website is functional at a
                      basic level as it contains a homepage that takes you to
                      more areas of the website, it is easy to navigate and
                      there is efficient information for sections/areas of the
                      website you will encounter. Aesthetics are something I
                      look towards improving on as this website is a portfolio
                      sight I want it to look as appealing as the person it is
                      portraying. There are a few challenges with visually
                      pleasing effects I have encountered however this is mainly
                      due to my newness to the area of media queries in CSS.

                      To complete my website I was focused mostly on the stylist
                      and visual aspects of the elements in my website. For me,
                      a website that looks good can function well and looks also
                      are able to set a tone for the user, putting them in a
                      certain state of min. In my case calm and clear-minded as
                      there is firstly minimal elements and these elements are
                      also not complex relative to each other giving a calm and
                      easily interpretable feel to the website.

                  <div class="content">
                    <p>
                      The slides and lecture on user experience ethics provided
                      useful insight into the techniques used by major
                      corporations when designing their websites. In web design,
                      most will agree the main aim is to create space that not
                      only gives efficient information to your user but also
                      does this using functionality techniques that are easily
                      accessible and comprehendible by all who access the
                      website. With companies, however, this seems to be a lost
                      practice as the main aim of a business is to maximize
                      profit. Unfortunately for the user, maximising profit and
                      being ethical in design practices are not always
                      synonymous. This is why designers who are aware of design
                      ethics need to step into place ethics that benefit user
                      experience above design techniques that seek only the
                      user’s money to gain profits.

                      The main thing that went wrong with my website was the
                      folders not being able to be read on GitHub. This led to
                      the website not being able to be successfully published on
                      multiple accounts even. JavaScript navigation was a
                      problem as adding various navigation and functionality to
                      elements in the website was a struggle given JavaScript is
                      not my strongest point. Another issue was not having
                      completed the website in its entirety as week 7 of the
                      blog posts was missing. What did go well with the
                      submission was the website in its entirety. The page
                      functions well, the images were clear, the content and
                      information were precise, and the website looked good.
