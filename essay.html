            Superbalist is a South African online retailer with a focus mostly
            on fashion and accessories but also deals with décor and
            electronics. Its website follows the same trend in terms of various
            content that all work together to form this working website. In this
            essay, the Superbalist website shall be analysed by its design
            aspects, factoring in its user interface elements and the user
            experience created from interacting and analysing the interactive
            design ethics found within the website to critique the website in
            its entirety. The content and information discussed are accurate as
            of the 2nd of May 2023, information found may be subject to change
            upon viewing the site at a later stage.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraphs">
            Having well-executed user interface elements enables the interface
            of the website to be easily interpreted and beautiful. The home page
            to contains a somewhat logical flow. The viewer’s eyes to some
            extent always scroll down as information scrolls up however this is
            not always constant as at some point your eyes are to move across
            the page or even stay static to allow the change in the flow of
            information. Superbalist counters this problem by displaying clear
            elements that provide legible and readable information. They achieve
            this by using serif fonts (specifically sans serif) and this is to
            ensure the user can read the words on the screen. This strictness in
            font does change to a combination of Arial (a font deemed to be
            highly legible) and sans-serif in the checkout pages as this part of
            the website is crucial for the user to be able to read and input the
            correct information. However, they seem to neglect this clarity of
            information with the use of colour. Fashion is an industry of loud
            and robust expression however in some cases (such as website design)
            it is important to be aware that many people, of different
            backgrounds and knowledge, will have to view and interpret your
            website. Having an overload of colours on the homepage can easily
            draw many people away as there is no synchronicity in the elements
            displayed. They do rectify this by switching to white backgrounds on
            products (once you start viewing them) however this effort can be
            too little too late as most consumers will not even reach the point
            of seeing a more balanced colour scheme due to the home page’s
            complexities. The text colour choice however in these crucial
            screens is concerning as the use of a light grey on a white
            background is straining and not fully legible. The website is easily
            accessible on various devices through being able to adjust to
            various screen sizes and the content will still be perceivable and
            operable. Keeping up with good website design techniques,
            Superbalist’s website can be interpreted by screen readers allowing
            further access to different individuals. The website also uses
            familiar signs and semantics that can help the user whilst
            exploring. Starting with symbols, the menu bar, search bar, and
            shopping cart icon are all easily identifiable by users allowing
            them to always understand the content shown at all times keeping
            these patterns constant throughout the site can also build an
            ability to be able to control how they interact with the site as
            they always know what to do with the element found on the site.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraphs">
            The website’s interactive design is pleasing as seen through its use
            of dropdowns. This feature is common in many websites and rightly so
            as it affords the user more knowledge and information and keeps a
            minimal look only serving to show the pages a user can explore and
            nothing else. The use of high-quality imagery is aesthetically
            pleasing as it gives the website a clean professional look to its
            products. The use of both a navigation bar (header) and a search bar
            allows the user multiple ways to find what they are looking for in
            the website limiting the possibility of being lost.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraphs">
            An adequately built <abbr title="User Experience">UX</abbr> system
            can help a user accomplish their goals. This is mostly through
            influencing and manipulating the user’s experiences and emotions and
            as Hassenzahl (2006) stated <q>Experiences have advantages</q>. The
            following are a few laws to achieve a healthy user experience and
            how Superbalist compares in each regard. The Locality laws state
            that elements should be placed in areas where they will influence
            change, if an element causes a change across an area, it should be
            placed above the affected area and finally, if an element affects
            change far from the area it should stand out. The Superbalist
            website does not fully follow any of the locality laws. The left
            sliding menu is affected button by a top left-placed menu bar button
            and buttons that lead you to specific pages are placed after the
            preview of the page (page titles are usually found underneath
            pictures that relate to the page). There is also a lack of
            “stand-out” elements which gives balance to the whole page as
            nothing is given more weight than its counterparts. Drawing on
            standing out gives rise to Van Restorffs effect of things in a crowd
            that stand out and are more remembered. As mentioned before few
            elements are given more weight than their counterparts and this
            leads to the page relying on other methods of relaying importance.
            This brings about a problem when you consider Hicks Law on how the
            time taken to make a decision increases as the quantity and the
            complexity of the choices increase. The Superbalist page has
            numerous subpages, making the home page elements hold equal weight,
            which makes it harder for a user, who does not know what they want
            when first visiting the page, to choose what to do next. There are a
            lot of pages to explore and a lot of content to take in so at face
            value this may be a lot for the user to process making it not
            effective for a first-time user to traverse through the site. The
            serial position effect does deal with a few of the aforementioned
            problems regarding an overload of information as this law states the
            first and last items in a series are remembered by the user and
            Superbalist takes advantage of this by making the featured
            style/collaboration of the day be the two popular figures in the
            creative industry (Daliwonga and Nqobile Khwezi). Making this the
            first section of the website keeps users drawn in as these are
            people of interest. Almost all the elements found on the website are
            buttons of different shapes and forms and this stylistic choice also
            affects the user’s experience. The use of square buttons (in the
            form of images) is common in corporate and fashion websites, and
            this could be because they can give a sense of containment and
            discipline giving a professional setting and setting a tone of
            seriousness. Circular buttons are also present on the website
            contradicting the already-established professional mood created as
            these styles of buttons are more playful and endearing. They are
            minimally used to not cause a shift in the tone of the website and
            can be interpreted as giving relief to the serious nature being
            enforced throughout the website.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraphs">
            Some ethics have to be considered when viewing the user experiences
            created by interacting with the website as a user’s experience is
            being manipulated in ways more than simply making them feel serious
            because the website is serious. The first issue is that of the
            inequalities presented on the website. One can argue that given the
            website originates from South Africa it would be designed in a
            manner that is aware of social contexts in South Africa. South
            Africans spend on average around
            <a
              href="https://brandsouthafrica.com/168/how-south-africans-spend-their-income/"
              class="u-url"
              >5%</a
            >
            on clothing and footwear. This may not be alarming at first glance
            however for a poor country with individuals that do not have that
            much disposable income this figure can be considered too high. The
            reason for such high spending could be through websites such as
            Superbalist that offer constant discounts on products which act as
            incentives to users to always spend more on things they may not
            necessarily need.
            <q>Digital inequalities mirror existing social inequalities</q>
            (Robinson, 2015) and this is prevalent in this website as South
            Africans are not money savvy in the real world having only a
            <a
              href="https://www.iol.co.za/business-report/budget/south-africas-household-saving-rate-at-03-how-can-you-be-clever-with-your-credit-804691df-ade3-4912-be44-ae1a07e6856f"

              >0.3%</a
            >
            savings rate on their income. Companies are aware of this problem
            however they aim to see users spend more on their advertised
            products without any regard for consumer social statuses and
            Superbalist has reaped the benefits of this having made over
            <a class="u-url" href="https://pipecandy.com/companies/superbalist"
              >$75m (R1,463b)</a
            >
            in sales. This brings rise to the more pressing matter of being able
            to influence user behaviour. This can be done a step further by the
            external website factors such as the newsletter and email ads always
            promoting discounts and sales prevalent on the website. The use of a
            user’s personal information to bombard them with ads and newsletter
            updates is an ethical issue on two levels, causing a distraction in
            the user’s life and neglecting privacy (through always sending users
            updates and needing the user’s information in the first place). This
            can be taken a step further to being seen as exploiting the user for
            the sake of selling them products. The website is thus lacking in
            terms of being cordial to website design ethics and this is a common
            downfall faced by such websites as they always tend to value the
            company’s values more than the user’s needs.

            Using the stylistic, <abbr title="User Interface">UI</abbr>,
            <abbr title="User Experience">UX</abbr> and interactive design
            elements essential for designing a well-functioning website
            Superbalist’s website can be deemed to be an effectively designed
            website. For the business, it communicates its products well and has
            efficient functionality however consumers are provided with more
            than enough information however they may also be overloaded with
            knowledge and nudged into making involuntary decisions. It is an
            efficient website but improvements can and need to be made.
